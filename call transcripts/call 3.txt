Hi, Dale. This is Arison with NLA Investigative Division. If I told you this was a call regarding compliance laws related to Georgia senate bill 68, Would you throw your phone out the window, or let me have 30 seconds and then decide? We're using AI voice tech to get the word out.
9:29:48 AM(+00:28.39)

Great. To be clear, we have a solution for the new compliance laws within Georgia Senate Bill 68. Can I give you the context so you can decide if it's relevant?
9:30:08 AM(+00:48.95)
You
Sure. Go ahead.

Thank you, Dale. Georgia's Senate bill 68 introduces new compliance requirements that organizations must adhere to. Particularly concerning workplace violence liability. 1 critical aspect is the foreseeability trap. Which involves criminal activity within 500 yards of your facilities. Many companies mistakenly believe that having guards and cameras alone will suffice. But that doesn't address the underlying risks. Our firm is the first and only 1 in Georgia offering a comprehensive solution that includes crime data analysis for your specific location. This helps identify potential risks and ensures compliance. Preventing financial penalties and damage to your reputation. Does that sound relevant to your organization?
9:30:20 AM(+01:00.65)
You
Yes. I'd definitely sounds relevant to my organization.
9:31:03 AM(+01:44.20)
Assistant
I'm glad to hear that, Dale. For your privacy, I am calling on an line, so there may be some unnatural pauses in my response. Is that okay?
9:31:07 AM(+01:48.21)
You
It's okay.
9:31:17 AM(+01:57.87)
Assistant
Thank you for your understanding. Now to ensure we can discuss your specific facility risks in detail, I'd like to schedule a meeting. When are you available in the next couple of days?
9:31:20 AM(+02:00.51)
