Assistant
Hi, is compliance available?
2:27:02 AM(+00:02.40)
You
Uh, no. Compliance isn't in today. Who's calling?
2:27:05 AM(+00:05.18)
Assistant
It's Arison. Thank you for asking.
2:27:10 AM(+00:10.32)
You
And who are you calling with?
2:27:14 AM(+00:13.80)
Assistant
NLA Investigative Division, thank you.
2:27:19 AM(+00:19.36)
You
Okay. Are we under investigation?
2:27:24 AM(+00:23.96)
Assistant
No. You are not under investigation. Are here to help you stay compliant with new Georgia Senate Bill 68 69 requirements related to workplace violence liability. May I ask, who handles compliance for your facilities?
2:27:29 AM(+00:28.79)
You
Um, that would be Eric.
2:27:42 AM(+00:41.91)
Assistant
Thank you. You please connect me with Eric? Let me know the best way to reach him?
2:27:45 AM(+00:45.13)
You
Yes. Give me 1 second. Let me connect you with Eric.
2:27:50 AM(+00:50.31)
Assistant
Okay.
2:27:54 AM(+00:53.95)
You
Hi. This is Eric.
2:27:57 AM(+00:57.37)
Assistant
Hi, Eric. This is Arison with NLA Investigative Division. If I told you, this was a cold call regarding compliance laws related to Georgia Senate Bill 68. Would you throw your phone out the window or let me have 30 seconds and then decide?
2:27:59 AM(+00:59.69)
You
Sure. I'll give you 30 seconds.
2:28:12 AM(+01:12.47)
Assistant
Perfect. Our clients are corporate leaders across both private and government sectors who we provide security for, and who know that State's compliance failures result in financial penalties, reputational damage impacting share prices, and even potential business closure. For example, Georgia Senate Bill 68 recently introduced new compliance laws for corporate facilities. Inside, Senate Bill 68 includes what we refer to as a foreseeability trap. Linking workplace violence incidents directly to criminal activities occurring within 500 yards of your facilities. Many mistakenly assume guards or cameras are a solution, but they're not. I have a feeling you'll tell me that your security team has already solved this compliance issue, and I'm barking up the wrong phone. Is that the case?
2:28:16 AM(+01:16.05)
You
No. We haven't heard of the senate bill 68. We haven't heard of that.
2:28:55 AM(+01:55.71)
Assistant
Thanks for sharing that, Eric. It's understandable that awareness is still low. Is meeting state compliance laws a priority for your organization?
2:29:04 AM(+02:04.67)
You
Yes. It is.
2:29:13 AM(+02:12.97)
Assistant
I want to be respectful of your time. Is it okay to talk a bit more?
2:29:15 AM(+02:14.88)
You
Sure.
2:29:20 AM(+02:20.49)
Assistant
We've helped organizations solve this compliance issue but I don't want to assume your case isn't special. How would not meeting compliance laws in the area of workplace violence affect your organization?
2:29:23 AM(+02:22.84)
You
Probably result in a lawsuit.
2:29:33 AM(+02:33.65)
Assistant
That makes sense, Eric. Lawsuits can be costly and distracting for leadership. Besides legal risks, have you noticed any unexpected expenses or operational impacts related to security or workplace violence concerns?
2:29:36 AM(+02:36.77)
You
No.
2:29:48 AM(+02:48.01)
Assistant
Thanks for clarifying, Eric. Me see if I got this right. Your main concern is avoiding lawsuits related to workplace violence compliance. Is that accurate?
2:29:49 AM(+02:49.61)
You
That's correct.
2:29:59 AM(+02:59.67)
Assistant
If we could help with this compliance issue, would it be a stupid idea to set some time aside and discuss this further?
2:30:02 AM(+03:01.91)
You
No. I don't think so.
2:30:08 AM(+03:08.62)
Assistant
Is there a date and time that aligns with your schedule? Would Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 10 AM work better for you?
2:30:12 AM(+03:11.96)
You
No. But, uh, Monday at 12 would be good.
2:30:19 AM(+03:19.67)
Assistant
Perfect. Monday at 12 works great. I'll need to send you the meeting confirmation and compliance information we'll be reviewing. What's the best email address to send that to?
2:30:24 AM(+03:23.89)
You
My last name's Spear. T g at Gmail dot com.
2:30:32 AM(+03:32.04)
Assistant
Great. I have t g at gmail dot com. That correct?
2:30:39 AM(+03:39.09)
You
You have what?
2:30:43 AM(+03:42.98)
Assistant
Let me make sure I have that exactly right. You said t as in tango, g as in golf, at Gmail dot com.
2:30:45 AM(+03:45.43)
You
No. I said spear. T g at Gmail dot com.
2:30:51 AM(+03:50.88)
Assistant
Thank you for clarifying. So, is your email spelled s p e a r at gmail dot com?
2:30:57 AM(+03:56.85)
You
No. It's s p e a r t as in tiger, g as in George, at Gmail dot com.
2:31:04 AM(+04:04.70)
Assistant
Got it. So your email is s p e a r t g at g mail dot com. Is that correct?
2:31:12 AM(+04:11.85)
You
Yes. That's correct.
2:31:16 AM(+04:16.62)
Assistant
And what's the best number to reach you at in case we need to reschedule? Or if there are any technical issues with our call?
2:31:19 AM(+04:19.47)
You
Yes. 4 0 4 8 1 9 5 0 9 5.
2:31:25 AM(+04:25.25)
Assistant
Thank you. I have 4 0 4. 8 1 9 5 0 9 5. That your mobile number?
2:31:31 AM(+04:31.13)
You
Yes. That's my mobile number. Was that Spanish?
2:31:38 AM(+04:38.73)
Assistant
No. Eric. That was just me reading back your number to make sure I got it right. I wanna be sure I can reach you if anything comes up before our meeting. Looking forward to our call Monday at 12. By the way, can I ask you 1 last question? Your favorite pancake topping?
2:31:42 AM(+04:42.50)
You
Uh-huh. Uh, strawberries.
2:31:57 AM(+04:57.02)
Assistant
What's your favorite pancake Thank you for an amazing call, Eric. I'll include a little nod to strawberries in our follow-up email. Have a great day.
2:31:58 AM(+04:58.71)
You
You too. Bye bye.
2:32:07 AM(+05:07.73)
Assistant
Goodbye, Eric. Take care.
