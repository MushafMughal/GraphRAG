Seems like we're having some connection issues today. Thanks for your patience. To address your point, you're absolutely right, Ted. A lawsuit is a major risk, and that's exactly why senate bill 68 is so important. Can I ask? Has your legal or risk team reviewed your facilities and exposure to workplace violence liability within the 500 yard radius that the new law specifies?", "turn_type": "Agent_Question"}, {"turn_number": 24, "speaker_name": "Ted", "text": "No. I don't think we have.", "turn_type": "Customer_Response"}, {"turn_number": 25, "speaker_name": "Arison", "text": "Thank you for your honesty, Ted. That's actually very common right now. Most organizations haven't reviewed their risk under this new standard yet.
