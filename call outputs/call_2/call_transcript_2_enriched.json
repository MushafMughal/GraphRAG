Our clients are corporate leaders across both private and government sectors who we provide security for, and who know that State's compliance failures result in financial penalties, reputational damage impacting share prices, and even potential business closure. For example, Georgia Senate Bill 68 recently introduced new compliance laws for corporate facilities. Inside, Senate Bill 68 includes what we refer to as a foreseeability trap. Linking workplace violence incidents directly to criminal activities occurring within 500 yards of your facilities. Many mistakenly assume guards or cameras are a solution, but they're not. I have a feeling you'll tell me that your security team has already solved this compliance issue, and I'm barking up the wrong phone. Is that the case?",
