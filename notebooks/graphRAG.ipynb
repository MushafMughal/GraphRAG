Our clients are corporate leaders across both private and government sectors who we provide security for, and who know that State's compliance failures result in financial penalties, reputational damage impacting share prices, and even potential business closure.

Linking workplace violence incidents directly to criminal activities occurring within 500 yards of your facilities. Many mistakenly assume guards or cameras are a solution, but they're not. I have a feeling you'll tell me that your security team has already solved this compliance issue, and I'm barking up the wrong phone.

      "11: Okay.\n",

      "15: Perfect. Our clients are corporate leaders across both private and government sectors who we provide security for, and who know that State's compliance failures result in financial penalties, reputational damage impacting share prices, and even potential business closure. For example, Georgia Senate Bill 68 recently introduced new compliance laws for corporate facilities. Inside, Senate Bill 68 includes what we refer to as a foreseeability trap. Linking workplace violence incidents directly to criminal activities occurring within 500 yards of your facilities. Many mistakenly assume guards or cameras are a solution, but they're not. I have a feeling you'll tell me that your security team has already solved this compliance issue, and I'm barking up the wrong phone. Is that the case?\n",
      "17: Thanks for sharing that, Eric. It's understandable that awareness is still low. Is meeting state compliance laws a priority for your organization?\n",
      "19: I want to be respectful of your time. Is it okay to talk a bit more?\n",
      "21: We've helped organizations solve this compliance issue but I don't want to assume your case isn't special. How would not meeting compliance laws in the area of workplace violence affect your organization?\n",
      "23: That makes sense, Eric. Lawsuits can be costly and distracting for leadership. Besides legal risks, have you noticed any unexpected expenses or operational impacts related to security or workplace violence concerns?\n",
      "25: Thanks for clarifying, Eric. Me see if I got this right. Your main concern is avoiding lawsuits related to workplace violence compliance. Is that accurate?\n",
      "27: If we could help with this compliance issue, would it be a stupid idea to set some time aside and discuss this further?\n",
      "29: Is there a date and time that aligns with your schedule? Would Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 10 AM work better for you?\n",
      "31: Perfect. Monday at 12 works great. I'll need to send you the meeting confirmation and compliance information we'll be reviewing. What's the best email address to send that to?\n",
      "33: Great. I have t g at gmail dot com. That correct?\n",

      "15: Yes, I'm here. Apologies for the technical hiccup. Let me continue with what you were saying. Ted, are you the right person to discuss compliance for Georgia Senate Bill 8 and 69, or is there someone else on your team who handles that?\n",
      "17: Thank you for clarifying Ted. That's understandable. Awareness is still low since these requirements are new. Just to confirm, is meeting state compliance laws a priority for your organization?\n",
      "19: Perfect. You for confirming, Ted. I wanna be respectful of your time. Would it be okay to talk a bit more about how this new law could impact your compliance process?\n",
      "21: Thank you, Ted. We've helped organizations solve this compliance issue, but I don't want to assume your case isn't unique. How would not meeting compliance laws in the area of workplace violence affect your organization?\n",
      "23: I'm still with you. Seems like we're having some connection issues today. Thanks for your patience. To address your point, you're absolutely right, Ted. A lawsuit is a major risk, and that's exactly why senate bill 68 is so important. Can I ask? Has your legal or risk team reviewed your facilities and exposure to workplace violence liability within the 500 yard radius that the new law specifies?\n",
      "25: Thank you for your honesty, Ted. That's actually very common right now. Most organizations haven't reviewed their risk under this new standard yet. Would it be helpful if I showed you a brief analysis of your facility's specific compliance gaps? Especially regarding criminal activity within 500 yards. So you can see exactly where you stand.\n",

      "27: Thank you. Just to confirm, that's 4 0 4 8 1 9 5 0 9 5. Is that your mobile number?\n",
      "29: Excellent. So I have you down for Thursday at 9 AM. You'll receive a confirmation email at spear t g at g mail dot com shortly. And I'll include some preliminary information about your facility's 500 yard compliance zone. If anything changes, I'll reach you at 4 0 4 8 1 9 5 0 9 5. Looking forward to showing you exactly how Senate Bill 68 affects your property. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions? Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\n",
      "31: You're welcome, Dale. You for your time. I look forward to our meeting on Thursday. Have a great day.\n",
      "33: Goodbye.\n",
      "1: Hi, is compliance available?\n",
      "3: It's Arison. Thank you for asking.\n",
      "5: NLA Investigative Division, thank you.\n",
      "7: No. You are not under investigation. Are here to help you stay compliant with new Georgia Senate Bill 68 69 requirements related to workplace violence liability. May I ask, who handles compliance for your facilities?\n",
      "9: Thank you. You please connect me with Eric? Let me know the best way to reach him?\n",
      "11: Okay.\n",
      "13: Hi, Eric. This is Arison with NLA Investigative Division. If I told you, this was a cold call regarding compliance laws related to Georgia Senate Bill 68. Would you throw your phone out the window or let me have 30 seconds and then decide?\n",
      "15: Perfect. Our clients are corporate leaders across both private and government sectors who we provide security for, and who know that State's compliance failures result in financial penalties, reputational damage impacting share prices, and even potential business closure. For example, Georgia Senate Bill 68 recently introduced new compliance laws for corporate facilities. Inside, Senate Bill 68 includes what we refer to as a foreseeability trap. Linking workplace violence incidents directly to criminal activities occurring within 500 yards of your facilities. Many mistakenly assume guards or cameras are a solution, but they're not. I have a feeling you'll tell me that your security team has already solved this compliance issue, and I'm barking up the wrong phone. Is that the case?\n",
      "17: Thanks for sharing that, Eric. It's understandable that awareness is still low. Is meeting state compliance laws a priority for your organization?\n",
      "19: I want to be respectful of your time. Is it okay to talk a bit more?\n",
      "21: We've helped organizations solve this compliance issue, but I don't want to assume your case isn't special. How would not meeting compliance laws in the area of workplace violence affect your organization?\n",
      "23: That makes sense, Eric. Lawsuits can be costly and distracting for leadership. Besides legal risks, have you noticed any unexpected expenses or operational impacts related to security or workplace violence concerns?\n",
      "25: Thanks for clarifying, Eric. Me see if I got this right. Your main concern is avoiding lawsuits related to workplace violence compliance. Is that accurate?\n",
      "27: If we could help with this compliance issue, would it be a stupid idea to set some time aside and discuss this further?\n",
      "29: Is there a date and time that aligns with your schedule? Would Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 10 AM work better for you?\n",
      "31: Perfect. Monday at 12 works great. I'll need to send you the meeting confirmation and compliance information we'll be reviewing. What's the best email address to send that to?\n",
      "33: Great. I have t g at gmail dot com. That correct?\n",
      "35: Let me make sure I have that exactly right. You said t as in tango, g as in golf, at Gmail dot com.\n",
      "37: Thank you for clarifying. So, is your email spelled s p e a r at gmail dot com?\n",
      "39: Got it. So your email is s p e a r t g at g mail dot com. Is that correct?\n",
      "41: And what's the best number to reach you at in case we need to reschedule? Or if there are any technical issues with our call?\n",
      "43: Thank you. I have 4 0 4. 8 1 9 5 0 9 5. That your mobile number?\n",
      "45: No. Eric. That was just me reading back your number to make sure I got it right. I wanna be sure I can reach you if anything comes up before our meeting. Looking forward to our call Monday at 12. By the way, can I ask you 1 last question? Your favorite pancake topping?\n",
      "47: What's your favorite pancake Thank you for an amazing call, Eric. I'll include a little nod to strawberries in our follow-up email. Have a great day.\n",
      "49: Goodbye, Eric. Take care.\n",
      "1: Hi. Is compliance available?\n",
      "3: Thank you for letting me know. Could you please connect me with someone who can assist with compliance regarding Georgia Senate bill 8?\n",
      "5: Thank you. I appreciate your help. I'll hold for Dale.\n",
      "7: Hi, Dale. This is Arison with NLA Investigative Division. If I told you this was a call regarding compliance laws related to Georgia senate bill 68, Would you throw your phone out the window, or let me have 30 seconds and then decide? We're using AI voice tech to get the word out.\n",
      "9: Is 30 seconds okay?\n",
      "11: Great. To be clear, we have a solution for the new compliance laws within Georgia Senate Bill 68. Can I give you the context so you can decide if it's relevant?\n",
      "13: Thank you, Dale. Georgia's Senate bill 68 introduces new compliance requirements that organizations must adhere to. Particularly concerning workplace violence liability. 1 critical aspect is the foreseeability trap. Which involves criminal activity within 500 yards of your facilities. Many companies mistakenly believe that having guards and cameras alone will suffice. But that doesn't address the underlying risks. Our firm is the first and only 1 in Georgia offering a comprehensive solution that includes crime data analysis for your specific location. This helps identify potential risks and ensures compliance. Preventing financial penalties and damage to your reputation. Does that sound relevant to your organization?\n",
      "15: I'm glad to hear that, Dale. For your privacy, I am calling on an line, so there may be some unnatural pauses in my response. Is that okay?\n",
      "17: Thank you for your understanding. Now to ensure we can discuss your specific facility risks in detail, I'd like to schedule a meeting. When are you available in the next couple of days?\n",
      "19: Perfect. Thursday at 9 AM works great. Now I'll need to send you the meeting confirmation and compliance information we'll be reviewing. What's the best email address to send that to?\n",
      "21: Great. I have spear e g at Gmail dot com. Is that correct?\n",
      "23: Thank you for the correction. So that's spear t g at Gmail dot com. Is that right?\n",

      "33: Bye\n",
      "1: Hi, is compliance available?\n",
      "3: It's Arison. Thank you for asking.\n",
      "5: NLA investigative division. Thank you.\n",
      "7: That's correct. May I ask who I'm speaking with?\n",
      "9: Hi, Ted. I was hoping you could help me. I need to speak with the person responsible for compliance regarding Georgia's Senate Bill 68 and 69. Can you put me through?\n",
      "11: Thank you, Ted. I appreciate your help.\n",
      "13: Hi, Ted. I'm still\n",
      "15: Yes, I'm here. Apologies for the technical hiccup. Let me continue with what you were saying. Ted, are you the right person to discuss compliance for Georgia Senate Bill 8 and 69, or is there someone else on your team who handles that?\n",
      "17: Thank you for clarifying Ted. That's understandable. Awareness is still low since these requirements are new. Just to confirm, is meeting state compliance laws a priority for your organization?\n",
      "19: Perfect. You for confirming, Ted. I wanna be respectful of your time. Would it be okay to talk a bit more about how this new law could impact your compliance process?\n",
      "21: Thank you, Ted. We've helped organizations solve this compliance issue, but I don't want to assume your case isn't unique. How would not meeting compliance laws in the area of workplace violence affect your organization?\n",
      "23: I'm still with you. Seems like we're having some connection issues today. Thanks for your patience. To address your point, you're absolutely right, Ted. A lawsuit is a major risk, and that's exactly why senate bill 68 is so important. Can I ask? Has your legal or risk team reviewed your facilities and exposure to workplace violence liability within the 500 yard radius that the new law specifies?\n",
      "25: Thank you for your honesty, Ted. That's actually very common right now. Most organizations haven't reviewed their risk under this new standard yet. Would it be helpful if I showed you a brief analysis of your facility's specific compliance gaps? Especially regarding criminal activity within 500 yards. So you can see exactly where you stand.\n",
      "2: Is not available.\n",
      "4: Yes. Let me connect you with Dale.\n",

      "\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n",
      "1) Direct summary (last 2 calls)\n",
      "- Both calls were about the Georgia Senate Bill 68/69 compliance solution, targeted at Retail–Enterprise accounts.  \n",
      "- Outcomes: both calls resulted in a Meeting Scheduled.  \n",
      "- Quality scores: call_transcript_3 = 75, call_transcript_4 = 62.  \n",
      "- Call 3 (higher score): Arison used an engaging, slightly playful opener, identified company (“NLA Investigative Division”), referenced “AI voice tech”, asked for 30 seconds, asked 11 questions, got 9 customer responses, and included explicit closings confirming the meeting. No pain points captured.  \n",
      "- Call 4 (lower score): Arison used a direct referral-style opener asking to be put through to compliance, asked 7 questions, got 5 responses, captured one pain point (mention of a potential lawsuit and awkward pause), and had no recorded closing examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Patterns and themes among successful examples (what makes them work)\n",
      "- Short, time-bound ask up front: “30 seconds and then decide” reduces friction and gets permission to continue.  \n",
      "- Clear identification of agent and company early (builds credibility).  \n",
      "- Conversational/engaging tone: rhetorical question or light humor lowers resistance.  \n",
      "- Higher question count + more customer responses correlate with better outcome (more engagement).  \n",
      "- Explicit scheduling/closing language seals the next step (call 3 included closings confirming meeting).  \n",
      "- Referencing the topic plainly (compliance/Ga SB 68) upfront focuses the call and signals relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Concrete, actionable recommendations for the script\n",
      "Recommendation 1 — Adopt a 15–30 second, permission-based opener:\n",
      "- Script line: “Hi [Name], this is Arison with NLA Investigative Division. This is about Georgia Senate Bill 68/69 compliance — do you have 30 seconds so I can explain why this matters to retailers like you?”  \n",
      "- Why: low-friction, establishes company, topic, and asks permission which increases listen rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation 2 — Use a brief value statement + 2 quick diagnostic questions to drive engagement:\n",
      "- After permission: one-line value statement (e.g., “We help enterprise retailers avoid enforcement risk and potential litigation tied to SB68/69.”), then 2 open diagnostic questions: “Who handles SB compliance today?” and “Have you reviewed SB68/69 impacts yet?”  \n",
      "- Why: focuses the conversation, uncovers ownership/pain quickly, and increases customer response count (linked to meeting success).\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation 3 — Always confirm the next step with a firm closing and handle pauses proactively:\n",
      "- Closing script: “Great — I’ll put 30 minutes on your calendar for [date/time]. Is that time good, or would [alt time] work better?” If a long pause or confusion appears, use a short clarifying phrase: “I realize this is a lot — would it help if I briefly summarized the risk and what we’d cover in the meeting?”  \n",
      "- Why: explicit scheduling prevents lost opportunities (call 4 lacked a closing), and proactive bridging reduces awkward pauses and perceived confusion about risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Optional quick tweaks for tone and content\n",
      "- Keep the opener confident but friendly; avoid sounding script-like. Use the recipient’s name early.  \n",
      "- If the call hits a legal/”lawsuit” pain mention, acknowledge it (“I hear you — that’s exactly why a short review can be important”) and move to schedule a deeper conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Quick metrics to track going forward\n",
      "- Use these KPIs to measure improvement: permission-yes rate on opener, customer response count per call, question count per call, meeting-confirmation rate, and presence of an explicit closing. Aim to increase customer response count and question count to match the higher-scoring call pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want, I can draft a short script template (opening, 2 diagnostic questions, and a closing) that integrates these recommendations.\n"
