    "1.  **`call_session` (Object):**\n",
    "    *   `session_id`: A unique ID for the call (e.g., \"call_transcript_1\").\n",
    "    *   `outcome`: You MUST choose EXACTLY one value from this list: `[\"Meeting Scheduled\", \"Rejected\", \"Gatekeeper Block\", \"Voicemail\", \"Follow-up Required\", \"Wrong Person\", \"Call Dropped\"]`.\n",
    "    *   `product_focus`: The main product discussed (e.g., \"NLA Security Solution\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`participants` (Array of Objects):**\n",
    "    *   `name`: Full name of the participant (e.g., \"Arison Josh\", \"Dale Spear\", \"Unnamed Gatekeeper\").\n",
    "    *   `role`: MUST be one of: `[\"Agent\", \"Recipient\", \"Gatekeeper\"]`.\n",
    "    *   `organization`: The organization they belong to.\n",
    "\n",

    "            ### Agent-Centric Labels\n",
    "            - **Opening**: The agent's very first lines to the decision-maker. (e.g., \"Hi Sarah, this is James from Acme Corp. Thanks for taking the time.\")\n",
    "            - **Closing**: The agent's last few lines before the call ends. (e.g., \"Thankyou for the time, I'll send over the info by email.\")\n",
    "            - **Gatekeeper_Dialogue**: Any exchange that happens `before` the decision-maker is on the line (includes both agent + gatekeeper). (e.g., \"Can I speak with Mr. Davis?\", \"He's not available right now\")\n",
    "            - **Agent_Question**: When the agent asks a question to gather information or move the conversation forward. (e.g., \"Are you currently using outside counsel for compliance?\")\n",
    "            - **Agent_Response**: When the agent directly answers a customer's question, objection, pain point, or buying signal. (e.g., \"We already have a vendor. → Agent: Totally understand. Many of our clients started in the same place.\")\n",
    "            - **Rapport_Building**: Non-business, relationship-focused statements or light humor. (e.g., \"Hope you had a good weekend.\", \"I'm a pancake person too.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "            ### Customer-Centric Labels\n",
    "            - **Customer_Question**: Customer asks for clarity, detail, or next steps. (e.g., \"Can you explain how that works\", \"What's the cost?\")\n",
    "            - **Customer_Response**: Neutral or factual statements that do not qualify as a question, objection, pain point, or buying signal. (e.g., \"No, I'm not the right person.\", \"I work in finance, not compliance.\", \"Okay.\")\n",
    "              ⚠️ **Note:** A simple \"No\" or \"Not really\" → goes here **unless** it explicitly conveys resistance to the product/meeting (in which case it is a `Customer_Objection`).\n",
    "            - **Customer_Objection**: Customer resists, refuses, or dismisses the agent's proposal. (e.g., \"We're not interested.\", \"We already have a provider.\")\n",
    "              ⚠️ **Important:** A normal \"No\" or short denial **does not count as an objection** unless it is clearly rejecting the agent's pitch or request.\n",
    "            - **Customer_Pain_Point**: Customer explicitly mentions a business problem, risk, or dissatisfaction. (e.g., \"We've had compliance gaps in the past.\", \"That would probably result in a lawsuit.\")\n",
    "            - **Customer_Buying_Signal**: Customer shows agreement, alignment, or willingness to continue. (e.g., \"Yes, that sounds relevant,\" \"Yes, I am available,\" \"That's correct.\").\n",
    "\n",
    "            ### System / Meta Labels\n",
    "            - **Technical_Issue**: Mentions of call quality problems, pauses, or audio glitches. (e.g., \"Are you there?\", \"There's a long pause.\")\n",
